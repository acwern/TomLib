#Welcome!

Hello there. From time to time I will create something for C which I will likely need again in the future. This is essentially an archive of all such things.

I am looking at going back to optimise things or make them more readable at times, and as my skill with C increases I hope to achieve this.

If anyone has any improvements they'd like to suggest, just let me know. I'm open to learning. 

I try to follow similar philosophies to coding as laid out on cat-v.org, however with my currently limited knowledge of C this is difficult. Hence any tips on this will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for browsing my archive!
